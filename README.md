# AiMouse
Mouse control with hand gestures, using computer vision with Python.


### üí° How to use it:
1. Download `HandTrackingModule.py` and `CVVirtualMouse.py` files.
2. See the **Requirement** section for installation requirements.
3. Once it's up and running you'll notice the front camera will open up and a window will pop up.
4. Your index finger will serve as a mouse. 
   <br> Just leaving your index finger up will activate navigation or movement mode.
   <br> If you want to click on something raise your middle finger to do so.
   <br> I'm currently working on adding the drag-click and right-click to the project.
